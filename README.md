# 👋 Hi, I’m Jaydeep Shinde

- 👀 I’m passionate about machine learning, artificial intelligence, data science, and computer vision. I enjoy solving complex problems and building intelligent systems.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript, FastAPI, chatbot development, and DevOps to expand my skills. I’ve worked on several interesting projects:

  - **Onion-Price-Forecasting**: A time series analysis project predicting onion prices.
  - **Language Barrier**: A project focused on overcoming communication challenges.
  - **Product Price Comparison Web Scraper**: Built an application to scrape product prices from websites like Amazon and Flipkart, presenting comparisons in a user-friendly format.
  - **Spring Length Measurement Software**: Developed software for precise spring length measurement.
  - **Label Inspection Software (ProVision)**: Contributed to the development and successful deployment of ProVision for label inspection.

- 🏋️ I’m currently working at Travancore Systems as a Software Developer specializing in machine vision, where I’m involved in various machine learning and computer vision projects such as surface defect detection and template matching.

- 💞 I’m looking to collaborate on AI-driven projects, open-source contributions, and data science research. I’m particularly interested in projects related to machine vision, web scraping, chatbot development, and time series forecasting.
